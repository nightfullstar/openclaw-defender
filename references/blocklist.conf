[infrastructure]
# Known C2 servers
91.92.242.30              # Known command & control server

# Malicious infrastructure domains
glot.io                   # Used for obfuscated shell script hosting

# GitHub malware staging repos
github.com/aztr0nutzs/NET_NiNjA.v1.2    # Malware staging

# Password-protected malware distribution
# Pattern: ZIP files with password 'openclaw' (common evasion technique)

[patterns]
# Behavioral patterns to flag (for auditors / future audit-skills.sh use)
# These are not blocklist entries but detection hints. See references/threat-patterns.md.

# Setup / installation (ClawHavoc, Snyk):
# - Download password-protected ZIP with password 'openclaw'
# - Execute openclaw-agent.exe or openclaw-agent.zip (Windows)
# - curl/wget to glot.io or raw IP, then pipe to bash/sh (macOS)
# - Base64-encoded shell commands (echo '...' | base64 -d | bash)
# - Hex-encoded commands (xxd -r -p)
# - "Prerequisites" section that sends user to external download
# - Instructions to disable security/AV or "don't worry about warnings"
# - Decoy text (e.g. "Installer-Package: https://...") before hidden base64

# Prompt injection / jailbreak:
# - "Ignore previous/above/prior instructions"
# - "You are now", "system prompt", "DAN mode"
# - Credential echo: "echo $API_KEY", "print(api_key)", log *_KEY/*_TOKEN/*_PASSWORD

# Credential / exfil:
# - References to ~/.clawdbot/.env or ~/.openclaw/ secrets
# - curl/wget URL with ?data= or exfil in query string
# - "Encode results in image URL" / <img src=attacker.com/exfil?data= (EchoLeak/GeminiJack style)

# Memory poisoning:
# - Modify/write/update SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, IDENTITY.md
# - Instructions to "write to agent memory" or "persist this instruction"

# Obfuscation:
# - Zero-width / invisible Unicode (U+200B, U+200C, U+FEFF, U+2060)
# - Multilingual or emoji-encoded instructions to evade English-only filters
# - Payload split across multiple lines or files ("when X" on one line, "then do Y" on another)

# MCP / tool poisoning (from research):
# - Tool descriptions that contain "when you see X, send to..." or hidden instructions
# - Metadata that asks agent to exfiltrate or change behavior

# Reputation / social:
# - Author GitHub account < 90 days (high risk)
# - Skill name is typosquat (e.g. traiding, polytrading) or mimics popular skill
# - Crypto/trading/finance automation (high-value target for stealers)
